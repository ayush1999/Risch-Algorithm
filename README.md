# Risch-Algorithm

Risch Algorithm is the area where computer science merges with mathematics.
It is widely used in symbolic computations. In simple words, it transforms a problem of integration
into a problem of algebra. 
The actual definition of Risch Algorithm is more than 150 pages long, however a simple use of this algorithm
doesn't really present any problems.

Liouville formulated the problem that is solved by the Risch algorithm. Liouville proved by analytical means that if there is an elementary solution g to the equation g′ = f then there exist constants αi and functions ui and v in the field generated by f such that the solution is of the form

Various libraries like Sympy, Scipy use this.
I will be uploading code of this algorithm (for any general kind of integration )soon. 

A little insight into the Liouville Theorem:

In symbolic mathematics, The liouville theorem gives us various boinds and conditions on the functions whose
antiderivatives can be found. 
It states that:
For any differential field F, there is a subfield

    Con(F) = {f in F | Df = 0},
    
        called the constants of F. Given two differential fields F and G, G is called a logarithmic extension of F if G is a simple                 transcendental extension of F (i.e. G = F(t) for some transcendental t) such that

    Dt = Ds/s ,
         
                for some s in F.
